# Loan Approval Prediction Using Python

This repository contains a Python-based project to predict **loan approvals** using machine learning techniques. The project walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to create an accurate loan approval prediction system.

## 📌 Overview

Loan approval prediction systems assist financial institutions in assessing the eligibility of applicants for loans. This project demonstrates the step-by-step development of such a system using Python, with a focus on data analysis, machine learning, and performance evaluation.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create new features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Visualize model performance and feature importance.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.
